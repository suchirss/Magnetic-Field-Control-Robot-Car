- Implemented a transmitter circuit for robot car controller, utilizing an ATMega328P microcontroller, RLC circuit, and joystick, achieving control over the robot car's movement through signal transmission and distance tracking. 
-	Developed a receiver circuit equipped with inductive sensors, PIC32 microcontroller, and bidirectional motor drivers, enabling a control system that allows the robot car to respond to transmitter commands with precise movements.
